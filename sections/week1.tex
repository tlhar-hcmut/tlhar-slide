\begin{frame}{What is machine learning?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Arthur Samuel described it as: "The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
        \item Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
    \end{itemize}
